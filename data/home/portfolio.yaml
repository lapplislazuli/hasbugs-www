    title: "Information"
    text: "What is happening? To effectively work with bugs, you need to understand the problem. 
    Many datasets lack descriptions, or are defined by 'failing ci'. That is not enough! 
    A lot of research had issues due to missing information, or produced patches could not be assessed. 
    Also, different task need different information - for many datasets these are only derived from builds or using tools. 
    We deserve better."

    title: "Reproducibility"
    text: "Recently someone asked me if it is worth the effort caring for reproducibility. 
    Noone reuses your things and if one or two people want to, they can just sent you an email. 
    I am still thinking a lot about this. I think there is some truth to it.
    However, I have also seen how much time and energy I used to reproduce results.
    Maybe exact reproducibility is a myth, but wouldn't it be nice to have things that give some output?"

    title: "Accessability"
    text: "Things you can't use are not really useful. 
    We know that working with datasets isn't exactly a walk in the park. 
    By design it's a hard task, and organizing many different projects in the same way can be harmful too.
    Static approaches, dynamic approaches, grounded theory, etc. are all valid approaches that can bring us further as researchers.
    Let's try to help pick everyone up.

    title: "Quality"
    text: "Bugs are not the same. Datapoints can vary greatly in their information-granularity and quantity. 
    Many datasets mine their datapoints by automatic tools without manual inspection, or sampling at best.
    That leads to big datasets that can be used for machine learning, to produce models that are only evaluated on sampling.
    That is all fun and games, but to really put things to the test you need a human-evaluated gold standard to test against.
    We got you covered.
